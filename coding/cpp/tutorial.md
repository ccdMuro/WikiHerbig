## Entry Point

A C++ Programm begins with the `main()` funktion. This is the programms entry point, where it all beginns.

The least that one has to write so that the compiler recognizes the source code as valid C++:
```
int main () 
{

};
```
When compiled, you get an executable file that does nothing.

But there is still something we can look at. We have a *function definition*. So lets take this one apart.

- The name of the function or the *identifier* is `main`. 
- In fornt of the function name is the *return type* `int`.
- After the function name comes the *parameter list* `()` (it is empty in this example).
- The *function body* is enclosed by curly braces `{ }`.


> The space enclosed by curly braces `{  }` is called **scope**.
{.is-info}
